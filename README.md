#### describe 

This method is used to represent a group with related test blocks. This method needs to execute with two arguments â€“

* Test name
* A function


#### it 
This method executes a function to perform a test operation.

#### expect 
This method evaluates the result from the test block and performs the asserts statements.

#### toEqual 
This method is used to compare the expected result and the actual result.

#### beforeAll 
This method is executed only once in the test block to provide the description of the test suites. This function is called once, before all the specs in describe test suite are run.

#### afterAll

This function is called once after all the specs in a test suite are finished.

#### beforeEach
This function is called before each test specification, it function, has been run. beforeEach is fired before each test block.


#### afterEach

This function is called after each test specification has been run.
